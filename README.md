# issues

This repository is used for bug reports that are cross-project or not bound to a specific
repository (or to an unknown repository).

As an active project within the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) and as the reference implementation for
the infrastructure layer, we coordinate very closely there. It is very likely
that we will first need to evaluate and align feature requests, feature discussions, architectural proposals,
and things like that in the context of the SCS project.

The SCS project s the place where the common standards, the high level decision for the reference architecture
and reference implementation are discussed and aligned between the stakeholders. SCS is a open project
(in the sense of the four opens) and discussions and decisions are taken in a transparent process where
participation is very welcome.

As part of the Sovereign Cloud Stack project, various assumptions were made for the
reference implementation which OSISM does not want to or sometimes can not change indepdently from SCS.

If a feature
related issue requires a review in the Sovereign Cloud Stack project, this will be noted in the issue
and the issue will be tagged with an SCS tag. Afterwards, a review of the issue will take place in
one of the upcoming project meetings. Many OSISM related issues would be covered in the IaaS team,
please see https://scs.community/contribute/ for the public schedule of the SCS meetings.

Architectural decisions are going through a discussion and review process and are recorded in
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). Discussions on ADRs and on issues happen through GitHub
comments typically, but the non-trivial ones will typically also be discussed in the relevant
team meetings.

In order to put an issue on the agenda for the SCS IaaS team meeting, it is sufficient to write
a link to the issue in the SCS issue https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/46.
